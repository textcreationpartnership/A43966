            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Know you are no Stranger, in the dayes of your Pilgrimage, to the late and preſent rouling poſture of the wheels of Providence; you have ſeen the times tempeſtuous, and perilous; and God, who is the great Soveraign, hath ſeen good to bring an inſtance of the evil of this time, home to your Perſon and Family.</p>
            <p>Its good for your ſelf, with all other Relations that yet ſurvive, to look at the ſupream Diſpoſer; when the rongs of the wheels are high and dreadful, to eye him him that ſits upon the Throne: When Iſrael was as a woman forſaken, and grieved in ſpirit, its he that called her to it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. There is no Staff of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the hand of Providence, but it is grounded in the eternal Decree. And what if God willing that this or that or the other friend, or relation be made as it were a gazing ſtook to Angels and Men, through afflictions and reproaches? Who ſhall reply? Its lawful for him to do what he will with his own, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.15. <hi>Why doſt thou ſtrive againſt him?</hi> ſaith <hi>Elibu, Job.</hi> 23.13. <hi>He giveth no account of his matters.</hi> Its the duty of all friends to ſanctify God in his ſoveraign Diſpoſe, and with <hi>Aaron</hi> to hold their peace; not to repine or murmure at the diſpenſation of God, to ſubmit to his holy and ſoveraign will in this matter. The great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that which is moſt ſtudiouſly to be avoided, is not to be ſcandalized, nor to have our minds any wayes damaged, or diſcouraged in the courſe of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, nor alienated from the Church and People, and Servants of God, when ſuch inſtances occurr, that men upright with God, and walk cloſe with him, fall under ſuch great afflictions, not to think ſtrange of the fiery Tryal, nor the worſe of holy obedience, and the ſervice of God; this I ſay, is a great and hard Task; and when there are ſuch accidents falling out, friends receiving ſuch deadly wounds in the houſe of their friends, not to be exaſperated, nor violate the Rules of Charity, but to reſt in Love towards them, is another hard Task. This is the Task and duty incumbent upon you at this time; and herein I know in ſome me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as things have been circumſtanced, what need all that were nearly Related, and dearly Affected to him that is gone, I ſay, I know what need they have of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is a notable obſervation of Mr. <hi>Strong, The will of man ſubordinated to the Will of God,</hi> p. 289. <q>There are as great ſhares of Satan, and as great Judgements of God laid in Scandals, as in any thing in the world beſides:</q> 
               <hi>And he adds.</hi> (It is an Obſervation much to be conſidered) <q>That if Satan would inſtil any evil — preſſion, into the hearts of men, concerning any Truth of God (I may adde a <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

                  <pb facs="tcp:62256:3"/>as well, againſt any of the Wayes, Churches, Servants and People of God) he doth uſually bring it in by ſome providence of God that they take offence at:</q> As he inſtanceth in the <hi>Gaderens, Mat.</hi> 8.31. The Devil deſires to exaſperate their ſpirits againſt Chriſt, and he will doe it by drowning their hoggs. I am very ſenſible, in the Sufferings and Death of your deſervedly honoured Companion, and guide of youth, there was that, which except God give your ſelf, and all other friends, much Wiſdom, and Grace to ballance their ſpirits, the Devil may improve it to work a Prejudice of ſpirit againſt the Civil Government, Churches, Schools of Learning, againſt the holy wayes, and the Servants and Saints of God. Pardon me Madam, if I ſtay here, knowing what a Narrow this is, and earneſtly requeſt you for the Lords ſake, that you labour to guard your ſpirit and mind againſt this evil. I know full well with what Magnanimity and undauntedneſs of ſpirit, you paſſed through the gun-ſhot, and the heat of the day; but I beſeech you don't now ſtand at a diſtance from the Communion of the Churches and People of God, leſt Satan get advantage; for we are not ignorant of his Devices.</p>
            <p>The beſt Remedy againſt it is,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>A ſincere, meek and quiet ſubmiſſion to the ſoveraign &amp; holy Will of God:</hi> this will quiet our ſpirits ſo that Satan can't diſturb them. All the motions of our ſouls are excentrick &amp; diſordered till they come to this Subordination: we are open to the ſtorms, and fiery darts of hell, if not anchored in this Harbour.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>An intire and ardent Love to God, his Churches, Servants and People.</hi> If Love be interrupted, Satan has great Advantage of us: <hi>Qui ſatis deligunt non cite offendun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> Salv. Epiſt. 1. <hi>They that love much and enough, will not be ſoon offended.</hi> A brave Chriſt-like ſpirit it is to bury and paſs by real and ſuppoſed injuryes; and a great duty and concernment it is to live and dye in Charity.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>If I miſtake not, it was your deſign in coming into this Wilderneſs, that you might lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſs and honeſty: And although you have met with ſo great a tryal as you have, yet the Intereſt of God, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the Order of the Churches, the Truths and wayes, the Servants and Saints of God, and Communion with and in theſe, is as ſweet and precious as ever.</p>
            <p>I would not be underſtood by the world, nor be thought by your ſelf to know of, and be privy to any evil impreſſion upon your ſpirit, or to have an evil ſurmiſe concerning you, that the evil one hath touched you; but only as a faithful friend, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

                  <item>1. <hi>It is a time wherein Death hath received a large and high Commiſſion:</hi> Death hath reigned in the Region and Time wherein we live and dwell; it hath put forth its power, and hath received a Charge from God, where and concerning whom is uncertain, and how fan it may reſpect our Family and Relations, God only knows: but when it is in general a Dying time, and ſo many of our Relations are in the ſpace of thirteen years gone to their long home, it nearly concerns us that ſurvive, who know that God will b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He reſolves to wait all the dayes of his appointed time. A day, week, moneth or year was not ſufficient to compaſs ſo great a work in, but it will take up, and he reſolvedly devotes, all his dayes to it. Let no day paſs without a Line.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> many, have been ſummoned before the Tribunal of Chriſt in an inſtant: God has indeed granted to all thoſe that have lately died of our Family and Relations, ſome time, and to the moſt of them a long warning, and time of Preparation for Death. And it was remarkable in the Author of this Sermon, He long deſired that he
<pb facs="tcp:62256:4"/>might, if the Lord ſaw good, dye of a conſumptive &amp; lingering Diſtemper; and therefore when he found the grand ſigns of that Diſtemper, ſaid, that God had given him his deſire. And through infinite grace (which God ſhall be admired in them for) they were moved and ſtirred up to a ſolemn Preparation of themſelves, &amp; improving their ſpace given, that they might be prepared for Death: But God only knows (in whoſe hands our breath, &amp; our times and wayes are) what time and warning we ſhall have: its good therefore to be ready, prepared for the worſt: Receive the advice of Chriſt therefore, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.35.36. <hi>Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning, and ye your ſelves like unto men that wait for their Lord, when he will return from the Wedding, that when he cometh and knocketh, ye may open to him immediately.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Conſider what a diſmal thing it is to dye unprepared:</hi> For Death to come armed by Sin, with the curſe and wrath of God. To dye in our fins, it is to dye miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and to come to a miſerable end I may truely ſay of him that ſo dyes, <hi>An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely birth is better then be,</hi> as Eccleſ. 6.3. Yea, as Chriſt ſaid of him that betrayed him, <hi>It had be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n good for that man he had never been born.</hi> Hence Solomon tells us, Prov. 24.20. <hi>there ſhall be no reward to the evil man.</hi> No Reward? And yet is not <hi>Deſtruction to the wicked, and a ſtrange puniſhment to the workers of iniquity?</hi> Job. 31 3. Yea <hi>upon the wicked He</hi> i. e. God <hi>ſhall rain Snares, Fire and Brimſtone, and an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tempeſt,</hi> Pſal. 11.6 Yet the wiſe man faith, There ſhall be no Reward or End to the wicked man, <hi>i. e.</hi> it ſhall be worſe with him then if he had never been born. The Lord help us all to conſider it, and mind a timous and ſerious prevention of this diſmal iſſue.</item>
                  <item>5. <hi>A preparedneſs for Death will render us meet for all dutyes, and for all interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Changes.</hi> There is much ſervice, and many ſolemn changes before us: The voice of the Lord cryeth aloud to all men of Wiſdom, at this time to walk humbly with their God, to watch and pray. They that are fit to dye, they are and will be fit for any ſervice that God calls them to. Paul prepared for Death, and willing to dye, is fit to continue and abide with the Churches, and to be eminently uſeful for their furtherance, and joy of Truth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.25. There are ſolemn exerciſing Changes foretold by the fearful ſigns of this time; if we are prepared for Death, we are armed againſt the worſt, and to endure the greateſt affliction that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide us on this ſide Death, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.13. Paul being ready to dye, is ready for bonds and impriſonment at Jeruſalem. O how comfortable a thing is it to be ready to doe and ſuffer any thing for the Name of Chriſt? But not to inſiſt longer here. If we would be prepared for Death,
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Be and live in the daily and lively exerciſe of Repentance.</hi> It is Sin that makes Death bitter and terrible to the ſons of men. Be thorough and ſerious in Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for ſin: Let no ſin lye unrepented of. This was Pauls practice while he lived, to exerciſe himſelf <hi>to have a Conſcience void of offence,</hi> Acts 24.16. Not but that he had to charge himſelf with, and which Conſcience might accuſe him of, yea, but he cleared all Reckonings between God and himſelf, by a lively renewed exerciſe of Repentance. Paſs not a day without a ſerious, and cloſe review of your actions and wayes, and without deep ſearchings of heart, and repentings for all your errors, and violations of Gods holy Law, and your Rebellion againſt the
<pb facs="tcp:62256:4"/>Goſpel. Give diligence to be found of God in peace, and this will make the time of Death and Judgement, times of refreſhing, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19. If you can allow, and live in any known ſin, if you can digeſt ſin without great bitterneſs &amp; ſorrow, of a ſurety you are not prepared for this Change.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Believe to the ſaving of your Souls.</hi> Believe on the Name of the Lord Jeſus. To dye in truth, is to dye comfortably; it eaſeth and looſeth the pains of Death. This is the way to dye in the Lord, <hi>Rev,</hi> 14.13. and to ſleep in Jeſus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.18. <hi>i. e.</hi> in union with God in Chriſt. They that dye in Chriſt, will die in Peace, and be ſound of God in peace: for there is no condemnation to ſuch; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. And the blood of Chriſt alſo cleanſeth Believers from all ſin: now it is a bleſſed thing to be free from the guilt of ſin, and to have our conſciences purified in the blood of Chriſt; this will prepare us for an happy and comfortable Death. Now its the Son only that can make us free in this matter, and that muſt be in a way of union with Chriſt by Faith. O believe in the Lord Jeſus; he oft and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the renewed exerciſe of Faith: as it is ſaid of Abraham, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. <hi>He believed:</hi> Though he believed long before that, when he anſwered the call of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>By Faith Abraham when he was called, obeyed,</hi> and yet after this its ſaid <hi>He believed,</hi> as if he had not believed before.</item>
                        <item>3. <hi>Be throughly mortified to the world:</hi> Get your Affections crucified to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, pleaſures and profits of this life. Weep as though you wept not, Rejoyce as though you rejoyced not, Buy as though you poſſeſſed not, Vſe this world as not abuſing it, as the Apoſtle exhorts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.30, 31.

How long have I to live?</hi> O my friends, God forbid that you ſhould glory, ſave in the Croſs of Chriſt. If you are Chriſt's, then crucifie the fleſh, with its whole Train of carnal and ſenſual Luſts: theſe corrupt the judgement, and put a falſe varniſh upon the things of the world. It is a dreadfull ſign upon any ſoul to love the world, it undeniably evinceth, that the love of the Father is not in him. 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 2.15. And he that is deſtitute of the love of the Father, is not fit to dy. He ſhall never be received into the everlaſting Kingdome, that is totally deſtitute of the Love of God. O then mortifie and purge out all inordinate affection to the world, and the things of this life: whatever you doe, get your hearts dead to the Sins, Gallantryes and Jollityes of this time.</item>

            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:62256:6"/>
            <p> To make way for the Doctrine, it is neceſſary to enquire,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What is meant by Death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> By Death we are to underſtand natural or bodily Death: It is the Reſolution of the body into its firſt principles, by and upon the Seperation of the Soul from it, which is the cloſe of this life, and the beginning of another. There is a twofold conſideration of Death, as learned <hi>Paraeus</hi> notes on v 53.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a general and meer natural conſideration of Death, and ſo it happens not only to man, but to all Creatures living. 2. A Theological conſideration of it, as it is inflicted by the juſt puniſhing hand of God, and is a part of the curſe, and ſo it is a miſerable privation of Life, and ſo it is to be conſidered here, as a judicial penal evil; and ſo armed with its ſting it is the greateſt evil in the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>What are we to underſtand by the Sting of Death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The ground-work is Metaphorical, the Apoſtle herein allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to venomous Creatures, as ſnakes, ſerpents and vipers, who are by nature armed with a ſting for offence and defence; ſo Death hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it offenſive until it be removed. A Sting (at leaſt in common account) is the chief ſubject of venome, and the inſtrument whereby ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous creatures pierce others, and convey their poyſon into them, ſo as to fill them with pain and anguiſh.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Sting of Death is its ſtrength and power to annoy and hurt. The ſting of death, in a ſimilitude and reſemblance of a ſerpent, is its offending power: the ſting of death is ſin, as in v. 56. Sin arms death, and the Law impowers ſin, and hence death hath its ſting, its power to offend and hurt ſinners. Death is the fruit and conſequent of ſin <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. Sin entered, and Death followed after; hence Death comes as an Evil not only as a natural, but as a penal and judicial evil, as I hinted before. Now ſin gives ſtrength and power unto Death, ſo that he th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> dyes in his ſins has a very ſtrong Death; for ſin puts forth all its pot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> and poyſon to the utmoſt in the infliction of death upon the ſinner <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> cauſeth death to pierce, pain and poiſon the ſinner, it lets out the wrath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which is to come upon the ſinner: it opens a door to endleſs and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corleſs torments: it makes the parting with life and the comforts of it bitter to the ſinner: hence in the death of a ſinner all his ſins are revived and the curſe ſeizeth on him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>What is meant by the Apoſtles thus ſpeaking in a Way of triumph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Glorying?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:62256:7"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is a figurative manner of ſpeech, in which Death is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to as in the form and guiſe of a Perſon, as an Officer coming under Commiſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It imports that his power was loſt as to the Apoſtle, and ſo all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; ſo the Apoſtle includes all believers, <hi>v.</hi> 57. <hi>who giveth us the victory.</hi> Deaths commiſſion and power is taken away: it comes not as a penal and judicial evil to the Saints, not as a part of the curſe, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main of the croſs, an evil of affliction ſanctified and eminently conducing to their good: hence the Apoſtle gloryes over it, not in a way of proud inſulting but in an humble triumph of faith in God through Chriſt, which plainly argues death, as to him and all believers, was ſpoiled of its power.</p>
            <p>Hence we may take up theſe two Doctrines of juſt and weighty Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>That there is a ſore and grievous Sting in natural Death, or natural Death is armed by Sin with a ſore and grievous Sting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. 2. <hi>That the Sting of Death is certainly and infallibly taken out, ſo that it cannot really hurt, prejudice or annoy true Believers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two Doctrines doe contain the true meaning and intent of the Apoſtle in theſe words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is a ſore and grievous Sting in natural Death.</hi> This lies firſt in our way. Never ſhall we ſee our deliverance fully, till we ſee our danger, nor be ſenſible of the excellent remedy, till we have felt the ſmart of the fore: hence many men out of ſtupidity, or a wilful ſlighting or refuſing to mind their death, their laſt end, have made too light a matter of it; but of a truth, when death comes armed by ſin, with an high Commiſſion from the Law, it will be found to be piercing, painful and poyſonous.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore in the firſt place endeavour to ſhew more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what the Sting of Death is before I come to ſhew how it is taken out. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ow there are ſeveral Stings in Death,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt ſting in death is, that it came into the world through mans own fault, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>By one man ſin entered, and death by ſin, and death paſſed upon all men, &amp;c.</hi> It is ſin brought in death as a curſe and puniſhment. Death comes from God, not as inſtituting the courſe of Nature at firſt; but as revenging ſin. There is a Saying in <hi>Ecclſiaſticus</hi> that God did not make Death: true, it is not a Creature, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62256:7"/>of the Creature. God is not the peccant cauſe of the falling of this houſe of clay, but our ſin, as <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.18. Its plain in the tenor of the firſt threatning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. They are Malefactors that are ſentenced, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> judged and condemned to die. Every ſinner dyes as a Malefactor, as an evil doer ſuffering for his own ſin. And truely it pierceth deep if a man conſider, that he fetcht the Viper out of the ſnow and nouriſhed it in his own boſome, which now doth ſting and devour him. When a man muſt ſay, <hi>In me convertite ferrum, mea caedes, mea fraus omnis.</hi> When it ſhall be told him as <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Thine own wickedneſs ſhall correct thee.</hi> And as <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.18. <hi>thy way and doings have procured theſe things unto thee: this is thy wickedneſs.</hi> We like the fooliſh woman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.1. pull down the houſe over our heads, with our own hands. Before we feel the burthen of ſin our own will to it, is our warrant for it, and becauſe our ſelves have done it, we can eaſily excuſe it: but at laſt it will ſting like an Adder. This will double the burthen, this will be enough to ſilence any ſufferer in this laſt execution of Juſtice upon him, <hi>i.e.</hi> in this life. This conſideration will devolve all the load upon our ſelves. Who ſhall relieve us? Who ſhall grieve for us? Whom ſhall we blame? but even leave our complaint upon our ſelves,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Sting in Death is, that it comes from the Wrath of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.50. <hi>He made a way to his anger, and ſpared not their ſoul from death.</hi> God takes away the wicked in his wrath, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.9. Death is his deſtroying Angel that chaſeth them out of the world. There are two thing, in a curſe or puniſhment,
<list>
                  <item>1. Something that is evil, ſome oppreſſing evil.</item>
                  <item>2. The wrath of God mixt with it.</item>
               </list> Now death is a part of the curſe, now this is piercing and painful indeed, for a man to be taken away in wrath: <hi>Sinners in Sion are afraid,</hi> and a <hi>fearful thing it is to tall into the hands of the Living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Another ſting in death is, that it is the puniſhment due to ſin. It comes armed therefore with a Commiſſion, to take ſatisfaction for of ſence and wrong done to the infinite God. It is the wages of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi> We were bound upon peril of our lives, and on pain of death, to keep Gods Law, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>In the day thou cateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely dye:</hi> that being broken death enſues, and ſeizeth on us as our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So <hi>v.</hi> 22. of this Chapter. <hi>In Adam all aye.</hi> Sin and puniſhment goe together. When the body of ſin goes before, Puniſhment as its ſhadow attends it: When <hi>Eve</hi> brought forth a ſon, ſhe was brought
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62256:8"/>a bed of death; according to the Proverb, <hi>Ex malo Corvo malum Ovum.</hi> The Jews have a Saying. <hi>There was never any puniſhment hapned to them, but there was anounce of the golden calf in it.</hi> So there is no death. but there are ſome drachmes of ſin in it. The lively Image of Sin is ever to be ſeen in Death. Would you ſee the ſad influence that moiſture hath upon iron? Look upon the ruſt of it. Would you ſee the horrid evil of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs? Look upon the effects of it. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.29. <hi>Who hath woe? who hath ſorrow? Who hath contention? Who hath babling? Who hath wounds without cauſe? Who hath redneſs of eyes?</hi> v. 30. <hi>They that tarry long at the wine, they that goe to ſeck mixt wine.</hi> So here. Who hath ſhortneſs of breath, a pale countenance a crazy body, Catarrhs, Epilepſies, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyes, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> They that continue in ſin. <hi>Why doth the living man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain?</hi> Lam. 3.39 <hi>A man for the puniſhment of his ſin?</hi> This ſtings pains and pierceth the ſinner when death comes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another ſting in death is, that it ſeparates the ſoul and body each from other. Theſe antient friends, whoſe lives and happineſs here (as Jacobs was in Benjamins, <hi>Gen.</hi> 44.30.) lare bound up in one anothers welfare. <hi>Will ye take Benjamin away? All theſe things are againſt me. If miſchief befal him, then ſhall ye bring down my grey hairs with ſorrow to the grave.</hi> Gen. 42 36, 38. So may the body which is ſo cloſly wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſo dearly affected to the ſoul ſay, If ye take away my ſoul, you take away my life. As it is reported of <hi>Madrian</hi> the Emperour, when he was dying, he thus trembling at the gaſtly countenance of the King of Terrors, beſpake his miſerable ſoul,
<q>
                  <l>Animula vagula blandula,</l>
                  <l>Hoſpes Comesque corporis,</l>
                  <l>Quoe nune abibit in loca</l>
                  <l>Pallidula, rigida, nudula;</l>
                  <l>Nec ut ſoles dabis Jocos.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>O thou little pleaſant wandring ſoul, the gueſs and companion of the body,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>what place will it goe? &amp;c.</hi> So hard did he find it for theſe two friends to part. If it be ſo hard for a man to part from a near Relation, from a familiar friend and acquaintance: how did Jonathan and David weep over one another? Ah then, what is it for a man to part from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to be rent a ſunder one part from another? The hardeſt knot, and the neareſt and deareſt Tye that ever was, muſt then be broken; and the ſtricteſt Union muſt then be diſanul'd, the ſoul turned out of its Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62256:8"/>on, the body left as a <hi>Vacuum Domicilium</hi> until the great Reſurrection; this muſt needs pierce and ſting, and fill with anguiſh in a dying hour.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another ſting in death is, that the body is conſigned over to a ſtate of corruption. <hi>Duſt ſhall return to the earth as it was,</hi> Gen. 3.19. <hi>with</hi> Eccleſ 12.7. The body muſt then be reduced and reſolved into its firſt Principles. When God takes away their breath, then all creatures dye, and return to their duſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.29. <hi>The earthly houſe of this Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle muſt be diſſoived,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. Taken down and in pieces, death feeds on them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.14. Here the body feeds upon death, dead creatures are its food, but now death ſhall feed upon men: by their death ſhall worms &amp; ſuch like vermin live. <hi>I have ſaid to corruption thou art my Father</hi> ſaith <hi>Job.</hi> C. 17.14. as concluding that his body muſt ſee corruption. Some of Gods precious ones, (as Dr <hi>Taylor</hi> ſaid of himſelf when condemned to be burned; have deceived many <hi>viz.</hi> the worms that waited for them. paſſing through a more ſpeedy corruption of their precious bodies, by the rage of their enemies: but the ordinary way is to rot in the grave. Now this car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yes a ſting with it, to think that worms ſhall deſtroy this fleſh, <hi>Job.</hi> 19.26. The bowels and the vital parts ſhall be the Region of vermine. When <hi>Joſeph</hi> is carryed out of Egypt, there is nothing but a Coffia of bones: and when you ſhall ſeek a Father or other Relation, or beſought for, there ſhall be nothing but Corruption, an ill ſavour or a few dry bones.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another ſting in death is, the dolorous accidents, and the heavy attendants that goe along with Death: There are many things fall in in a dying hour, there are the pains of death, grievous ſickneſs, faintneſs, outward parts grow numme, the eyes ſink, the lips quiver and tremble, the tongue falters, the breath whezeth and draws hard, the whole face waxeth pale, the heart beats and throbbs. Mark how Solomon in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.2. &amp;c. leads the old man to his grave, <hi>The ſun, or light ana the moon &amp; ſtars are darkned,</hi> the powers of the mind ſhallbe broken. Underſtanding Memory and Imagination darkned &amp; weakened. <hi>The Keepers of the houſe tremble,</hi> that is, the arms and hands through the abatement of the radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal heat and moiſture doe tremble. <hi>The ſtrong men bow themſelves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> i.e. the thighs and knees and feet grow feeble. <hi>The Grinders ceaſe</hi> that is, the Jaws and the Teeth loſe their ſtrength as to chewing the meat <hi>And thoſe that look out at the windows are darkned:</hi> that is, the eyes grow dim fighted. <hi>The doors are ſhut in the ſtreets, when the ſound of the grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62256:9"/>is low:</hi> the decoction of food is ſpoyled, and all the paſſages of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are obſtructed. <hi>He riſes up at the voice of the bird:</hi> his reſt departs from him, he is eaſily waked out of ſleep. <hi>All the daughters of muſick are brought low:</hi> both voice and hearing fail, Paſſions, and Fear eſpecially, is apt to move. His hair becomes hoary. He that was wont to bear bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, is now a burthen to himſelf appetite fails. Thus <hi>Man goes to his long home.</hi> And the <hi>Spina</hi> is looſed, the <hi>Pia mater</hi> and the Veins are broken, and the circulation of the blood is ſtopt: theſe laſt eſpecially are the conſtant and immediate Symptoms and ſore-runners of death.</p>
            <p>To have friends ſtanding by, ſome lamenting over us, others amazed, and ſtanding agaſt to ſee rooms made dark. Paul when his heart was ſound, tells his friends it was ready to break with the weeping of his friends whom he had told that they ſhould ſee his face no more. <hi>Act.</hi> 21 13. So it is here; when death comes, it tells our friends, that they muſt ſee our faces no more: This cauſeth great and grievous ſorrowing ſuch as is heart-breaking to thoſe that are dying. And we muſt then wind up with the ſad reckoning of Hezekiah. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 11, 12. <hi>I ſhall behold man no more with the Inhabitants of the world: Mine age is departed, he will cut me off with pining ſickneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. It puts an end to, and deſtroyes our purpoſes as to this liſen. All the vaſt projects and counſels of ſtare which Princes and great ones of the earth have upon the wheel. when their breath goeth forth, thoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.4.

Death admits of no after thoughts but <hi>as the tree falls to it lyes,</hi> Ecclef. 11.3.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62256:9"/>for all a mans hopes, deſigns, Projects &amp; devices to be brought to an end and to nought in one day, hour or moment.</p>
            <p n="8">8.

Its not ſo much as diſſolved, but releaſed and ſet at liberty. Sin here makes its motion towards heaven, and its progreſs in grace flow. The body is a weight preſſing down, but when Death ſhall rid us of this, the ſouls motion and paſs into heaven ſhall be quick and ſpeedy, like the Thief on the croſs, no ſooner crucified and dead, but glorified. <hi>This day,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>thou ſhalt be with me in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</hi> Let who will dream of the ſouls ſleep, they are aſleep that think ſo ſaith <hi>Calvin.</hi> No, aſſoon as the vail of the body is removed, we with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen face behold the Glory of the Lord.

Our friends lament, but Angels rejoyce: though we muſt now part from them, yet there is Gods Hoſt, the Life guard of heaven ready to accompany us thither.

            <p n="12">12. Deaths ſting is taken away, in that its made a paſſage into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The Saints they paſs from death to life, when the wicked paſs from death to death, from the firſt to the ſecond death. Hence they may be terrified at it, and ſhrink; but a Child of God when he conſiders its errand, that it comes to carry him hence to his Fathers houſe, he can entertain it with comfort. Death to the Saints is the middle point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two lives, it is an harbinger and fore-runner of their being recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved up. the righteous being taken up thus they enter into peace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.2 they never reach the end of their race till now they have ſhot this gulph; and now immediately they arrive at it.

Death is not an abiding, but a tranſient ſtate, like a dark entry into a lightſome room. Death doth aſſault but not conquer them: it ſhall not have dominion over them as it hath over the damned in hell: No, death and hell as to them ſhall be caſt into the lake of fire: its dominion is taken away here, yet its life is prolonged for a ſeaſon and time; as its ſaid of them Beaſts, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.12.

Paul preſſeth forward, and reacheth forth to thoſe things which are before, and his mark is the Reſurrection. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13.14.
